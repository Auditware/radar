certainty: Low
description: If a program is deriving a bump seed for a Program Derived Address (PDA) without ensuring its uniqueness, it could lead to collisions or unexpected insecure logical occurrences. Check for usage of program_id which is not part of Pubkey::find_program_address and there is a usage of "bump"
