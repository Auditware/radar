# What is radar

radar is a rule-based static analyzer for rust smart contracts, designed to run from a terminal on smart contracts downloaded locally.

It's written for smart contract developers and security auditors to aid in locating security vulnerabilities by programmatically searching the analyzed codebase for problematic patterns and heuristics.

As a key feature, radar exposes a pythonic querying mechanism that can empower creating new rules, whether for personal analysis or for community sharing. Each rule is shipped as a template file containing informational data on the vulnerability, and the logical rule to detect it.
